# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Module 1 Kickstarter

This analysis aims to help an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, *Fever*. She's estimating a budget of over $10,000 and is understandably hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. Louise also mentioned that she's also interested in Great Britain's theater market, especially musicals. While she's committed to creating a play in the U.S., she's also interested in researching musicals in Great Britain for a future project with an estimated budget of £4,000. This analysis uses Excel to organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful. Project viability, campaign start date, and campaign goal will all be discussed in this analysis.

### Analyis:
Given the Kickstarter data, which gives a wide variety of information of kickstarters between 2009-2017, Louise is positioned well to start a kickstarter for her play. The number of theater kickstarters far exceeded the amount of other kickstarter categories and a majority of them (57.5%) successfully raised the funds to get their project off the ground.

Taking an even deeper look within the space of theater kickstarters, many kickstarters for plays were successful within the US (61.4%), so I would advise Louise to be less nervous about raising the necessary funds.

So far we've established that Louise has a good chance of completing a successful kickstarter; the next important aspect is to imform Louise when would be an ideal time to start her funriasing campaign. Looking at theater kickstarters launched in the US by month, May was the most successful month with 67.7% of kickstarters launched that month resulting in a met goal. Most successful kickstarters had a fundraising period of about a month, so I would advice Louise to start her campaign in May and end her campaign in June!

In regards to her budget, I would reccommend Louise stick to a budget of around $3000. In the US, the average goal for a successful theater play kickstarter was $2500 (excluding outliers; an outlier was considered a goal amount of Q3+1.5IQR). The average amount pledged for these successful kickstarters was $2930. 75% of successful kickstarters had a goal amount of <=$4500, so setting a goal of around $3000 gives Louise a great chance of acheiving fundraising success.

Lastly, Louise was also curious about musical kickstarters in Great Britain. Once again, Louise has picked a target fundraising goal that is too high. According to successful musical kickstarters in GB, the average goal was £1250 and the average amount raised was £1328. 75% of GB musical kickstarters had a fundraising goal of <=£2000. As it seems like most musical kickstarters almost exactly meet their goals when successful, I would recommend Louise to set a kickstarter goal of ~£1250 so she has the best possible chance of meeting her goal.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, I recommend Louise to set a fundraising goal of $3000 and have her campaign run from May to June if she wants to set up a kickstarter for her upcoming play *Fever*. If one day she wishes to expand into the musical field in Great Britain, she should lower that goal to £1250.
